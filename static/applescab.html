    <h3>Disease and Ways to cure them:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis): Apple scab causes dark, scaly lesions on the leaves and fruit. Fungicides containing active ingredients such as captan, mancozeb, or myclobutanil are commonly used to control apple scab. Applying fungicides preventively before symptoms appear and following a regular spray schedule can help manage the disease</li><br>

        <li>Cedar Apple Rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae): Cedar apple rust affects both apple trees and cedar or juniper trees. It causes orange-brown lesions on the leaves and fruit of apple trees, along with raised, gelatinous spore-producing structures. Fungicides containing active ingredients like myclobutanil or triadimefon are often used for controlling cedar apple rust.</li><br>
      
          <li> Fire Blight (Erwinia amylovora): Fire blight is a bacterial disease that affects blossoms, shoots, branches, and fruit of apple trees. Infected tissue turns brown or black, resembling a burned appearance. Antibiotics like streptomycin or oxytetracycline are commonly used to manage fire blight. However, these treatments need to be applied during specific stages of growth and under proper weather conditions. </li><br>
      
            <li>Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha): Powdery mildew appears as a white, powdery coating on the leaves, shoots, and fruit. Fungicides containing active ingredients like sulfur, myclobutanil, or triadimefon can be used to control powdery mildew. Application timing and frequency may vary based on the specific fungicide and local conditions.</li><br>
      
              <li>Apple Canker (Nectria galligena): Apple canker causes sunken, corky lesions on branches, trunks, and sometimes the fruit. Pruning affected branches and applying protective wound dressings can help manage cankers. However, no specific chemical treatments are available for apple canker</li><br>

                           <u><b><h3>More way to cure specific diseases</h3>
    <li>Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis):</li><br></b></u>

Treatment: Fungicides specifically formulated for apple scab can be used. Apply fungicides preventatively based on local recommendations or consult with a professional for appropriate treatment options.<br>
<br>Nutrient Requirements: Maintain a balanced nutrient supply, especially with regard to nitrogen and potassium, to promote overall plant health and disease resistance. Regular soil testing can help determine the specific nutrient needs.<br>
<br>Watering Schedule: Water the apple trees deeply and infrequently, ensuring the soil is adequately drained. Avoid overhead watering, as excess moisture can promote disease development.<br>
<br>Pruning Technique: Prune apple trees to improve airflow and sunlight penetration within the canopy, reducing humidity and creating an unfavorable environment for disease development. Remove and destroy infected leaves or branches during pruning.<br>

<br><u><b><li>Apple Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha):</li><br></b></u>

<br>Treatment: Apply appropriate fungicides labeled for powdery mildew control. Follow the recommended application schedule and rates provided by the manufacturer or consult with a local agricultural extension for guidance.<br>
<br>Nutrient Requirements: Ensure the apple trees receive adequate potassium and sulfur, as deficiencies in these nutrients can make them more susceptible to powdery mildew. Adjust nutrient levels based on soil test results.<br>
<br>Watering Schedule: Practice proper irrigation management, avoiding excessive moisture on the leaves. Water the trees at the base, keeping the foliage dry as much as possible.<br>
<br>Pruning Technique: Prune apple trees to increase airflow and sunlight penetration, reducing humidity and creating an environment less conducive to powdery mildew development. Prune out infected branches or shoots during dormant seasons.<br>

<br><u><b><li>Apple Cedar Rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae):</li><br></b></u>

<br>Treatment: Fungicide applications are effective for controlling apple cedar rust. Apply fungicides during specific growth stages as recommended by local guidelines or consult with a professional.<br>
<br>Nutrient Requirements: Maintain a balanced nutrient profile, particularly with regard to nitrogen, to promote healthy growth and disease resistance in apple trees. Adjust nutrient levels based on soil test results.<br>
<br>Watering Schedule: Provide consistent and deep watering to apple trees, ensuring the soil remains evenly moist but not waterlogged. Avoid overhead watering, as this can promote disease spread.<br>
<br>Pruning Technique: Prune apple trees to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration within the canopy. Remove and destroy galls or rust-infected branches during pruning.<br>
