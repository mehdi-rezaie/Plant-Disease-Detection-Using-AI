    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Cultivation:</h3>
      <p>Purple grapevines require a suitable climate with warm summers and moderate rainfall. They are grown in vineyards and require proper training, pruning, and trellising to support the vine's growth and maximize grape production.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Storage:</h3>
      <p>Purple grapes are best stored in the refrigerator to maintain their freshness. They should be kept in a perforated bag or container to allow airflow. It is recommended to consume grapes within a few days of purchase for the best flavor.</p>

    <h3>Disease  and Ways to cure them:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Powdery Mildew (Uncinula necator): Powdery mildew appears as a white, powdery growth on the leaves, shoots, and fruit of grapevines. Fungicides containing active ingredients like sulfur, potassium bicarbonate, or synthetic chemicals such as triazoles and strobilurins are commonly used to manage powdery mildew. Application timing and frequency may vary depending on the specific product and local conditions..</li><br>

        <li>Downy Mildew (Plasmopara viticola): Downy mildew causes yellow or bronze spots on leaves, and a downy growth may appear on the undersides of leaves. Fungicides containing copper-based compounds or systemic chemicals like mandipropamid and dimethomorph are often used to control downy mildew. Regular spraying is recommended, especially during wet and humid periods..</li><br>
      
          <li> Botrytis Bunch Rot (Botrytis cinerea): Botrytis bunch rot can affect grape clusters, causing grayish-brown mold growth and rotting of the berries. Fungicides with active ingredients like fenhexamid, cyprodinil, and fludioxonil are commonly used to manage Botrytis bunch rot. However, cultural practices such as cluster thinning, improving airflow, and promoting dry conditions can also help prevent the disease.</li><br>
      
            <li>Black Rot (Guignardia bidwellii): Black rot causes dark brown or black lesions on grape leaves and fruit. Fungicides containing active ingredients like mancozeb, captan, or copper-based compounds are typically used to control black rot. Proper sanitation, removal of infected plant material, and pruning practices are also important in managing this disease.</li><br>
      
              <li>Grapevine Leafroll Disease (Various viruses): Grapevine leafroll disease causes red or purple discoloration of grape leaves, curling, and delayed fruit ripening. There is no cure for viral diseases, including grapevine leafroll disease. The primary management strategy involves using certified virus-free planting material and removing infected vines to prevent the spread of the disease.</li><br>
                </ul></div>

                <u><b><h3>More way to cure specific diseases</h3>
                <li>Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe necator):</li><br></b></u>

                <br>Treatment: Apply fungicides specifically formulated for powdery mildew control. Follow the recommended application schedule and rates provided by the manufacturer or consult with a local agricultural extension for guidance.<br>
                <br>Nutrient Requirements: Ensure the grapevines receive adequate potassium, calcium, and sulfur, as deficiencies in these nutrients can increase susceptibility to powdery mildew. Adjust nutrient levels based on soil test results.<br>
                <br>Watering Schedule: Practice proper irrigation management, avoiding excessive moisture on the leaves. Water the grapevines at the base, keeping the foliage as dry as possible.<br>
                <br>Pruning Technique: Prune grapevines to improve air circulation within the canopy, allowing better sunlight penetration and reducing humidity. Remove and destroy infected leaves or shoots during pruning.<br>
<br><u><b><li>Downy Mildew (Plasmopara viticola):</li><br></b></u>

<br>Treatment: Fungicides labeled for downy mildew control can be applied preventatively. Follow the recommended application schedule and rates provided by the manufacturer or consult with a local agricultural extension for guidance.<br>
<br>Nutrient Requirements: Maintain balanced nutrition, particularly with regard to nitrogen and potassium, to promote grapevine health and disease resistance. Adjust nutrient levels based on soil test results.<br>
<br>Watering Schedule: Practice proper irrigation management, aiming for well-drained soil and avoiding excessive moisture on the leaves. Water the grapevines at the base to keep the foliage dry.<br>
<br>Pruning Technique: Prune grapevines to improve air circulation within the canopy, reducing humidity and minimizing disease development. Remove and destroy infected leaves or shoots during pruning.<br>
<br><u><b><li>Black Rot (Guignardia bidwellii):</li><br></b></u>

<br>Treatment: Apply fungicides labeled for black rot control. Follow the recommended application schedule and rates provided by the manufacturer or consult with a local agricultural extension for guidance.<br>
<br>Nutrient Requirements: Maintain a balanced nutrient profile, ensuring sufficient potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels to promote healthy grapevine growth and disease resistance. Adjust nutrient levels based on soil test results.<br>
<br>Watering Schedule: Practice proper irrigation management, providing water to the grapevines at the base and avoiding overhead irrigation. Maintain good soil drainage to prevent excess moisture.<br>
<br>Pruning Technique: Prune grapevines to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration within the canopy. Remove and destroy infected leaves, fruit clusters, and canes during pruning.<br>
